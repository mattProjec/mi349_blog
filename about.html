        <p>Hi, my name is Matthew Kim and this is my about me. I'm currently a student at Michigan State University. I've been in Michigan my entire life and I love the community surrounding it. I plan on staying here for my entire life.</p>
        <p>I love playing video games, music, and hanging out with my friends. I like to cook in my free time and I also enjoy swimming outside when the weather allows for it. More to be written about me sometime in the future. Maybe.</p>
